	<h1>Poetry As an Example of Line Orientation</h1>
	

	<h2>Pastoral</h2>
William Carlos Williams, 1883 - 1963

The little sparrows<br />
Hop ingenuously<br />
About the pavement<br />
Quarreling<br />
With sharp voices<br />
Over those things<br />
That interest them.<br />
But we who are wiser<br />
Shut ourselves i<br />
On either hand<br />
And no one knows<br />
Whether we think good<br />
Or evil.<br />
Then again,<br />
The old man who goes about<br />
Gathering dog lime<br />
Walks in the gutter<br />
Without looking up<br />
And his tread<br />
Is more majestic than<br />
That of the Episcopal minister<br />
Approaching the pulpit<br />
Of a Sunday.<br />
These things<br />
Astonish me beyond words.<br />
