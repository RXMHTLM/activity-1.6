    <h2>One Technology at a Time</h2>
    <p>When you are told to or read about integrating technology into your classroom, what is your immediate thought? Do feelings take precedence over rational thought. Do you feel overwhelmed and under trained? Do you immediately decide that a career change might be the next best step?</p>
    
    <p>Be reassured that it is common to respond in an emotional manner. Once rational thought has regained control, think about the current technology that is being used in your classroom by both students and yourself.</p>

      <h2>Placement of Any Kind of Content within the &lt;div&gt;Element</h2>
      <p>The &lt;div&gt;Element can be thought of as the any kind of container. You only want to<mark> use it as a last resort</mark>. A class attribute needs to be added to the div.  </p>
      
     <h2>Span I am</h2>
       <p>The &lt;span&gt element is an example of an inline container. The only way to show its nature, is to include a CSS file and the appropriate attribute: such as &lt;span class="blah1">Blah blip boop&lt;/span&gt</p>

	<h1>Poetry As an Example of Line Orientation</h1>
	

	<h2>Pastoral</h2>
<p>William Carlos Williams, 1883 - 1963</p>
<p>
The little sparrows<br />
Hop ingenuously<br />
About the pavement<br />
Quarreling<br />
With sharp voices<br />
Over those things<br />
That interest them.<br />
But we who are wiser<br />
Shut ourselves in<br />
On either hand<br />
And no one knows<br />
Whether we think good<br />
Or evil.<br />
<!--The next line's two words, "Then again..." is suppossed to be indented as such
Or evil.
                Then again,..." but only a CSS style sheet can do that, I think; not standard html markup. -->
Then again,<br />
The old man who goes about<br />
Gathering dog lime<br />
Walks in the gutter<br />
Without looking up<br />
And his tread<br />
Is more majestic than<br />
That of the Episcopal minister<br />
Approaching the pulpit<br />
Of a Sunday.<br />
These things<br />
Astonish me beyond words.<br />

<h3>One Word - Three Definitions</h3>

<h4>Definition of <em>Word</em></h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>A sound or a combination of sounds, or its representation in writing or printing,<br> that symbolizes and communicates a meaning and may consist of a single morpheme <br>or of a combination of morphemes.</li>
		<li>Something said; an utterance, remark, or comment: <em>May I say a word about that?</em></li>
		<li>Computer Science - A set of bits constituting the smallest unit of addressable memory.</li>
	</ol>
	
<h3>Use of Defintion tags instead of an ordered list</h3>

<p>Below is the example of a <e>definition tag</e>. It displays differently than the ordered list. I know that html is supposed to be used<br />
only for content not presentation, but I liked the look of the ordered list.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Word</dt>
		<dd>A sound or a combination of sounds, or its representation in writing or printing,<br /> that symbolizes and communicates a meaning and may consist of a single morpheme<br /> or of a combination of morphemes</dd>
		<dd>Something said; an utterance, remark, or comment: <em>May I say a word about that?</em></dd>
		<dd>Computer Science - A set of bits constituting the smallest unit of addressable memory</dd>
	</dl>
