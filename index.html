	<h1>Poetry As an Example of Line Orientation</h1>
	

	<h2>Pastoral</h2>
<p>William Carlos Williams, 1883 - 1963</p>
<p>
The little sparrows<br />
Hop ingenuously<br />
About the pavement<br />
Quarreling<br />
With sharp voices<br />
Over those things<br />
That interest them.<br />
But we who are wiser<br />
Shut ourselves in<br />
On either hand<br />
And no one knows<br />
Whether we think good<br />
Or evil.<br />
<!--The next line's two words, "Then again..." is suppossed to be indented as such
Or evil.
                Then again,..." but only a CSS style sheet can do that, I think; not standard html markup. -->
Then again,<br />
The old man who goes about<br />
Gathering dog lime<br />
Walks in the gutter<br />
Without looking up<br />
And his tread<br />
Is more majestic than<br />
That of the Episcopal minister<br />
Approaching the pulpit<br />
Of a Sunday.<br />
These things<br />
Astonish me beyond words.<br />

<h3>One Word - Three Definitions</h3>

<h4>Definition of <em>Word</em></h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>A sound or a combination of sounds, or its representation in writing or printing,<br> that symbolizes and communicates a meaning and may consist of a single morpheme <br>or of a combination of morphemes.</li>
		<li>Something said; an utterance, remark, or comment: <em>May I say a word about that?</em></li>
		<li>Computer Science - A set of bits constituting the smallest unit of addressable memory.</li>
	</ol>
	
<h3>Use of Defintion tags instead of an ordered list</h3>

<p>Below is the example of a <e>definition tag</e>. It displays differently than the ordered list. I know that html is supposed to be used<br />
only for content not presentation, but I liked the look of the ordered list.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Word</dt>
		<dd>A sound or a combination of sounds, or its representation in writing or printing,<br /> that symbolizes and communicates a meaning and may consist of a single morpheme<br /> or of a combination of morphemes</dd>
		<dd>Something said; an utterance, remark, or comment: <em>May I say a word about that?</em></dd>
		<dd>Computer Science - A set of bits constituting the smallest unit of addressable memory</dd>
	</dl>
